                    <li>Exercise regularly. Aerobic exercise raises your metabolism and eliminates toxins through sweat

                        unprescribed and over-the-counter medications, acidic liquids, salty foods (salt makes your body

                <p class="p-faq-title">Do Zydot products really work?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>Yes, Zydot products do work! We are fortunate to have many return customers who

                    guarantee on all Zydot products if you are not completely satisfied with your results.</p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">Are Zydot products safe?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'><span>Zydot Ultimate Blend</span> is made of all natural ingredients and are FDA
                    approved. <span>Our Ultra Clean Hair Purifying Treatment</span> is formulated to be gentle and safe
                    to your hair while removing unwanted toxins.</p>
                <p class="p-faq-title">Why do I need to remove toxins?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>No matter how "clean" a life you lead -- healthy eating, exercise, regular stress
                    relief -- your body is likely to show evidence of accumulated toxicity. A detox can help your body
                    to rid itself of some of these toxins, naturally, while also giving your body a chance to rest,
                    repair and regroup. Both your liver and your kidneys (along with your blood, bowel, lymphatic system
                    and skin) help your body process and eliminate impurities in your sweat, urine and feces. Detoxing
                    can help to support and enhance this natural process.</p>
                <p class="p-faq-title">When should I begin cleansing?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>The sooner you begin the cleansing process, the better your results and the
                    healthier you will be. Toxins are impurities or poisons that can lead to all sorts of health
                    problems. You should rid your body of any and all toxins on a regular basis to ensure proper health.
                </p>
                <p class="p-faq-title">How long do toxins remain in my body?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>That depends. Many different factors contribute to how long toxins remain in your
                    system including your metabolic rate, body condition, type of toxins, frequency and amount of toxins
                    that you come in contact with, as well as the amount of water you drink on a daily basis.</p>
                <p class="p-faq-title">How do I obtain the best results?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>First, do all you can to avoid exposure to any new toxins. Second, drink plenty
                    of water. Third, avoid alcohol, acidic liquids (vinegar, pickle juice, etc.) salty foods,
                    non-prescribed medications and large amounts of vitamins, and drink <span>Ultimate Blend
                    </span>after you have been awake for 4 to 5 hours.</p>
                <p class="p-faq-title">Why is it so important to follow the instructions?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>The instructions that accompany our products were developed to achieve maximum
                    effectiveness. When used improperly Zydot products are not allowed to perform the cleansing process
                    as intended, and may lead to unsatisfactory results.</p>
                <p class="p-faq-title">Can I take multiple Zydot products at the same time?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>Drinking more than one bottle of <span>Zydot Ultimate Blend</span> may not
                    increase effectiveness, and if you drink too much (more than 32oz) for any specific cleansing period
                    it may be counterproductive. However, we do recommend certain combinations of Zydot products that
                    can improve the cleansing process.</p>
                <p class="p-faq-title">Do Zydot products "mask" or cover-up toxins?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>No, Zydot products do not "mask" or cover-up toxins. Zydot products actually
                    cleanse or flush your body of unwanted toxins. Also, our products are made of all natural
                    ingredients that are commonly found in most healthy diets and they do not leave behind impurities of
                    their own.</p>
                <p class="p-faq-title">Will the toxins be gone for good?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>Your body is constantly releasing toxins into the urinary system as part of its
                    natural cleansing process. Zydot products will cleanse the toxins from the urinary system, however,
                    the toxins will return after a 4 to 5 hour period as a result of the body's natural cleansing
                    process.</p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">Are there any negative side effects?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>Zydot Ultimate Blend is a 100% natural product. However, as with any nutritional
                    supplement you may want to consult a physician before consuming.</p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">I don't think I have any toxins in my system, why should I still use Zydot
                    products?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>Sadly, the consumption of common everyday foods, prescriptions, and over the
                    counter medications can lead to toxin build up in the system. You may be contaminated with toxins
                    and not even know it. So it is better to be safe than sorry.</p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">Why is Zydot Ultra Clean Shampoo head and shoulders above the competition?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>Zydot Ultra Clean Internal Hair Purifying Treatment is actually three products in
                    one. A SHAMPOO, designed to wash away external barriers such as hair spray, styling and finishing
                    products, and everyday dirt and grime buildup to expose the inner hair. A PURIFIER, designed to
                    penetrate the hair shaft's inner structure to dissolve, release, and remove the chemicals and
                    medications bonded within the hair shaft, leaving your hair pure, clean and free of all unwanted
                    contaminants and impurities. And a CONDITIONER designed to control tangles, add sheen, and improve
                    manageability. Maybe ours is the best hair purifying treatment on the market for the simple reason
                    that it works better than any other product out there.</p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">Can I use Zydot Ultra Clean on my body hair?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>Yes. Zydot Ultra Clean Internal Hair Purifying Treatment is a full body shampoo,
                    purifier, and conditioner. If you are cleansing your hair you will want all of your hair cleansed.
                </p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">If my hair is very thick or very long will one package be enough?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>For individuals with extremely thick, coarse, curly and/or long hair (6 inches or
                    more), two or more packs of Ultra Clean Internal Hair Purifying Treatment may be needed. The process
                    works as long as there is a total saturation of the hair paying special attention to the hair
                    closest to the scalp. Toxins are harder to cleanse from very dark hair or thick and coarse hair.</p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">How much of my hair stores toxins? How long will toxins stay in my hair?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>The length of time that toxins are stored in hair will depend on the level of
                    toxin exposure, the type of toxins, your metabolism, and the length of your hair. The amount of hair
                    you should be concerned with is the first 1 1/2 inches closest to the scalp (approximately 90 days
                    of growth).</p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">What is the difference between the 16oz and the 32oz? How about the liquid or
                    powder?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>The Ultimate Blend 16oz is our standard product and is the best Detox drink for
                    most people. The Ultimate Blend 32oz is designed to accommodate individuals weighing 220 lbs. or
                    more and individuals who may have toxin levels exceeding normal levels. The powder product is
                    available in 16 oz. only and is the same exact product as the liquid version, minus the water.</p>

                <p class="p-faq-title">Why should I purchase Zydot over the competition?</p>
                <p class='faq__answer'>Simply put, because you want peace of mind — knowing that you are getting the
                    best Detox products on the market. Almost all companies offering Detox products are doing so as a
                    result of our pioneering efforts, and are marketing their products as "just like Zydot only
                    cheaper!" Why settle for a cheap knock-off of inferior quality. Trust only the First and the Best
                    Detox products on the market.</p>
